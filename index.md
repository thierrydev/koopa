Source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/acidgenomics/koopa).

# Requirements

- [POSIX][]-compliant shell: [Bash][] or [Zsh][]
- Linux or macOS

Dependencies for executable scripts:

- [Bash][] >= 4
- [Python][] >= 3.8
- [R][] >= 3.6

# Installation

Requirements: bash, curl, git.

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -sSL https://koopa.acidgenomics.com/install)"
```

The installer will prompt to determine whether you want a shared install for all users, or for the current local user only.

## Update shell configuration (local user only)

Note that this step is not required for a shared installation on Linux, which writes a configuration file into `/etc/profile.d` instead.

To activate koopa on login, add these lines to your shell configuration file:

```sh
# koopa shell
# https://koopa.acidgenomics.com/
# shellcheck source=/dev/null
XDG_CONFIG_HOME="${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-${HOME}/.config}"
if [ -f "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/koopa/activate" ]
then
    . "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/koopa/activate"
fi
```

Not sure where to source `activate` in your configuration? Here are some general recommendations, in order of priority for each shell. These can differ depending on the operating system, so refer to your shell documentation for details.

- [bash][]: `.bash_profile`, `.bashrc`.
- [zsh][]: `.zshrc`, `.zprofile`.

## Check installation

Restart the shell. Koopa should now activate automatically at login. You can verify this with `command -v koopa`. Next, check your environment dependencies with `koopa check`. To obtain information about the working environment, run `koopa info`.

# Docker images

## Recommended

These images contain koopa along with other useful bioinformatics software.
